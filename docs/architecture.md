# System Architecture

## High-Level Components

1. **Network Layer**: Handles client connections and protocol parsing
2. **Command Processor**: Processes incoming commands
3. **Data Storage**: Manages in-memory and persistent storage
4. **Data Structures**: Implements various Redis-like data structures
5. **Replication System**: Manages master-slave replication
6. **Cluster Coordination**: Handles sharding and distributed operations
7. **Security Layer**: Manages authentication and encryption
8. **Monitoring**: Collects and reports system metrics

## Data Flow

1. Client connects to the server
2. Network layer parses the command
3. Command processor validates and routes the command
4. Data storage layer executes the command
5. Response is sent back through the network layer

## Persistence Strategy

- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for durability
- Periodic snapshots for fast recovery
- Hybrid approach combining both methods

## Replication Architecture

- Master-slave replication with automatic failover
- Asynchronous replication by default
- Semi-synchronous option for higher durability
- Replication backlog for reconnecting slaves

## Cluster Coordination

- Hash slot-based sharding (16384 slots)
- Dynamic slot migration for rebalancing
- Leader election during network partitions
- Quorum-based failure detection

## Security Features

- Role-based access control
- TLS encryption for data in transit
- AES encryption for data at rest
- Command whitelisting/blacklisting
