# Design Decisions

## 1. Storage Engine

### Why LSM Tree?
- Better write performance compared to traditional B-trees
- More efficient for write-heavy workloads
- Provides good balance between read and write performance
- Efficient disk usage with compression

### Implementation Details
- In-memory memtable for recent writes
- Immutable memtables that get flushed to disk
- Compaction process to merge SSTables and remove duplicates
- Write-ahead log for durability

## 2. Network Layer

### Protocol Support
- Full support for Redis protocol (RESP)
- Pipelining support for improved performance
- Binary-safe commands and responses

### Connection Handling
- Goroutine per connection model
- Non-blocking I/O for efficient handling of many connections
- Support for TLS encryption

## 3. Replication

### Master-Slave Replication
- Asynchronous replication by default
- Semi-synchronous option for higher durability
- Replication backlog to handle reconnections
- Automatic failover using Raft consensus

### Cluster Mode
- Hash slot-based sharding
- Dynamic rebalancing of slots
- Leader election during network partitions
- Quorum-based failure detection

## 4. Security

### Authentication
- Password-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Command whitelisting/blacklisting

### Encryption
- TLS for data in transit
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- Key management integration

## 5. Monitoring and Metrics

### Collected Metrics
- Command execution counts and latencies
- Memory usage statistics
- Connection counts
- System resource utilization

### Exposed Endpoints
- INFO command for retrieving server information
- MONITOR command for real-time command logging
- STAT command for detailed performance metrics
